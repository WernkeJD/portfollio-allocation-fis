Mamdani FIS for factor based ETF Allocation

This file will store a modular fuzzy logic framework for generating ETF allocation 
recommendations based on macroeconomic indicators.  It mirrors the structure and outputs
of the static model in factors.py, but uses a rule-based Mamdani fuzzy logic system.

FIS Structure:
    Investible Factors: Liquidity, Beta, Volatility, Momentum, Growth, Dividend Yield

Layer 1 - Sentiment
---Policy---
Policy Inputs:
    Effective Federal Funds Rate: High = Tight, Medium = Neutral, Low = Loose
    Yield Curve Slope: Inverted = Tight, Flat = Neutral, Steep = Loose
    M2 Growth: High = Tight, Medium = Neutral, Low = Loose

Policy Output Sets: Tight, Neutral, Loose
    Loose Policy = ++Momentum, ++Growth, ++Beta, --DividendYield 
    Neutral Policy = Balanced Allocation
    Tight Policy  = ++DividendYield, ++Liquidity, --Growth, -Momentum

TODO, find more sources/reasoning for M2

---Growth---
Growth Inputs:
    Real GDP Growth Rate: High = Strong, Medium = Stable, Low = Weak
    Corporate Profits: High = Strong, Medium = Stable, Low = Weak
    Industrial Production: High = High = Strong, Medium = Stable, Low = Weak
    Private Nonresidential Fixed Investment: High = Strong, Medium = Stable, Low = Weak

Growth Output Sets: Weak, Stable, Strong
    Strong = ++Growth, ++Momentum, ++Beta, +Volatility
    Stable = Balanced Allocation
    Weak = +++DividendYield, ++Liquidity, --Volatility

---Risk---
Risk Inputs: 
    VIX: High = Risk-Off, Medium = Cautious, Low = Calm
    High-Yield Credit Spread: High = Risk-Off, Medium = Cautious, Low = Calm
    Economic Policy Uncertainty Index: High = Risk-Off, Medium = Cautious, Low = Calm
    Consumer Sentiment: High = Calm, Medium = Cautious, Low = Risk-Off

Risk Output Sets: Calm, Cautious, Risk-Off
    Calm = ++Growth, ++Momentum, ++Beta, +Volatility
    Cautious = +DividendYield, -Volatility, +Liquidity, -Momentum
    Risk-Off = ++DividendYield, --Volatility, ++Liquidity, --Momentum

---Liquidity---
Liquidity Inputs:
    Money Supply (M2): High = Loose, Medium = Neutral, Low = Tight
    Federal Funds Rate: High = Tight, Medium = Neutral, Low = Loose
    Credit Spreads:  High = Tight, Medium = Neutral, Low = Loose
